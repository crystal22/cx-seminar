# Main questions for the review

- Why is it difficult to study spreading phenomena in real-world social
  networks? 
- What can we do if we only have observational data?
- What are the roles of social groups in information diffusion?
- Does results in Ugander et al. and Weng et al. contradict each other? Why?
  Why not? 
- How much power does Facebook possess? What should we do about it?
