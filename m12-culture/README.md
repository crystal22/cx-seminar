# Main questions for the review

- What do you want to do with Google book n-gram data? What would be interesting questions that it can answer?
- What are the limitations of Google book n-gram data? What would be questions that it cannot answer at its present form?
- What are the new possibilities with cultural data?
- What kinds of (previously inaddressible) questions can be answered?
- How can we identify and handle biases in big datasets?
- What is the Pollyanna hypothesis? What would be the reason behind this phenomenon?
