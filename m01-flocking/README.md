# Challenge!

Create the most realistic flocks or schools! Use as much as knowledge you can
obtain from previous studies and your intuition & observation to create a
'realistic' flocking model. Record a video of the final results and prepare a
document that explains the mechanisms and rules of the flocking. This document
should (1) review the literature (2) identify the key findings about the
mechanisms of flocking behavior (3) explain how you improved your flock from
existing ones.

More concretely, address the following discussion questions, which will be
discussed during the class. In addition, identify a couple of other questions
that fascinate you and bring them to the class along with your research.

- Why do they flock?
- What are the mechanisms of flocking?
- What characterize the real flocking behaviors? Can we quantify them?
- Are all flocking (e.g. birds vs. fishes vs. ppl) created equal?

Note that there are already many implementations online that you can start
from!
